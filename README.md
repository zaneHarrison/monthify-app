# Monthify

Monthify is a web application that uses Spotify's API to automatically create Spotify playlists each month based on a user's Spotify playlist activity for that month. 

The backend consists of a Node.js server running Express as well as a MYSQL database to store user information. The frontend is built with Next.js.

Monthify is a personal project created by Zane Harrison.
